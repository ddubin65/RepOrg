<h2 id="rationale" class="context">Rationale</h2>
<p>The aim of this assignment is to help you relate the topics in our readings and discussions to concrete examples that you can explore in the homework assignments.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-begin" class="prereq">Before you begin</h2>
<p>In the next assignment, you will select ten (cultural or natural) resources of your choice for analysis and description. Before doing so, give some critical thought to the domain and/or genre from which you will select them. Consider characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our later exercises instructive for you. These characteristics might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your personal familiarity with and interest in the domain/genre.</li>
<li>Reasons people other than you have in locating and using resources of this kind. Competing or conflicting interests are often a good sign.</li>
<li>Problems with or limitations of current approaches to describing or classifying these kinds of resource.</li>
<li>Complexity of the resource (n.b., familiar resources are often more complex than meets the eye).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that a domain or genre is not a topic. If you select President Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) as the domain for this assignment, then for the next assignment you'll need to identify ten different deceased U.S. presidents, each of whom was named Abraham Lincoln, and each of whom lived from 1809 to 1865. Examples of more promising domains include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal articles in zoology</li>
<li>Your grandmother's postcard collection</li>
<li>Eighth century Byzantine coins</li>
<li>Prime numbers</li>
<li>Board games</li>
<li>Ethnographic data</li>
<li>Young adult novels</li>
<li>Mollusc shells</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tasks" class="steps">Tasks</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draft a short description of the domain that includes criteria for inclusion or membership.</li>
<li>List some characteristics of the domain that might pose descriptive challenges.</li>
<li>Consider whether other individual or community stakeholders might have interests in this domain.</li>
<li>Investigate whether any metadata vocabularies or classification systems have already been proposed for this domain.<br />
</li>
<li>Write a 1–3 page justification, focusing on the characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our later exercises instructive for you.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverable" class="result">Deliverable</h2>
<p>Upload the paper to the Moodle page for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes-for-this-assignment" class="postreq">Outcomes for this assignment</h2>
<p>After having completed this assignment you should have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reached a clearer understanding of what it means to be a well-defined resource domain;</li>
<li>Selected a promising starting point for the remaining class assignments;</li>
<li>Established a connection between the learning goals for this class and your own personal, professional, and educational interests.</li>
</ol>
