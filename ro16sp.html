information organization in different environments (e.g., libraries,
museums, archives, Internet, and within a single
organization).

Course overview and welcome
</H2>
<P>
I am
very happy to welcome you to LIS590-RO, and to express my strong
desire to make this a useful and productive course for you.  Many of
you are enrolling soon after completing the required core class on
information organization and access. Despite the generality of my
course's title and description, you have chosen to join RO rather than
one of its more specialized IO/KR siblings. Job ads in our professions
read like laundry lists of specialized skills, even at the best of
times. Even more so in times of economic stress, I think your choice
of a principles class shows courage and a recognition of the
importance of taking the long view of your professional career. I
congratulate you, and promise that I will work hard to justify your
faith.
</P>
<P>
Descriptive standards and practices are undergoing reforms,
both for familiar library resources and other types not traditionally
associated with our stewardship. We see new cataloging principles
being proposed, and harsh criticisms leveled against metadata
standards widely viewed as new and promising only a short time ago.
Responding, adapting, and even helping to frame these kinds of reforms
will be a part of your working life for the rest of your career.
Rather than delving into the particulars of the current debates, this
course aims to equip you to form your own views in debates current and
future. This will be accomplished through the construction of a
conceptual framework into which problems of resource description and
organization can be situated and understood. Along the way, you will
work on hands-on exercises that connect these concepts to practical
problems. But you should view these exercises not as skills to be
developed, but as vehicles for improving your understanding of
principles and concepts.

Learning Objectives
</H2>
<P>
Your instructor hopes to learn more about your objectives for
this course. His own objectives include the following:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Disentangle levels of abstraction that are commonly
blurred and confounded in the professional literature and discussion
of resource organization and description.
</LI>
<LI>
Build a conceptual framework that will help equip students
for more specialized IO/KR classes, and prepare them for inevitable
future changes to descriptive standards and practices.
</LI>
<LI>
Confront the complexities arising from our colleagues'
conflicting philosophical commitments, and understand the very
practical implications these basic world views have on our
professional lives.
</LI>
<LI>
Engage in resource description exercises that will help
make the concepts we read about and discuss more concrete, and provoke
us to think about them more deeply.

<DIV ID="INCLUSION"  class="SYLSEC">
<H2>
Statement of Inclusion
</H2>
<P>
The following expression is adopted from the Chancellor's
Commitment Statement of November 2012:
</P>
<P>
As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of world views, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.
</P>
<DIV class="SYLSUBSEC">
<H3>
Inclusiveness as a topic in LIS590-RO
</H3>
<P>
The models and theories we cover in this class frame the way
we understand resources, our professional roles with respect to their
stewardship, and the access and preservation problems to which our
efforts are directed. Under the right circumstances they can help make
our services more inclusive, as we've seen, for example, with the
digital encoding of writing systems and attention to web content
accessibility issues. But knowledge organization systems can also
marginalize, as reforms of library subject and medical classifications
 have shown. The assignment and project requirements described below
provide flexibility for students to relate broader course objectives
to their own learning goals, interests, and current or prior
professional experience. Your instructor invites you to consider among
those options exploring issues such as:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The needs of underserved communities
</LI>
<LI>
Preservation of cultural heritage
</LI>
<LI>
Institutional bigotry in classification systems
</LI>
<LI>
Wealth and power distribution impacts on standards development
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The readings and discussion topics for our class meetings are
selected with the aim of encouraging reflection and discussion, but
those choices are not socially or culturally neutral. Where we may be
missing opportunities to align the class content and conduct with the
values expressed in the inclusion statement, students are encouraged
to call classmate and instructor attention to those issues.

Basis for Grading and Evaluation
</H2>
<P>
The most important standards for success in a class like this
one are the educational goals that students bring to the class. Your
instructor hopes that the activities, assignments, and presentations
planned for this semester will be instrumental in your achieving the
goals you set for yourself. Each exercise and assignment has been
selected to provide an experience that will foster your own learning.
Do not think that grading and evaluative feedback are meant as
assessments of your success or failure in the class: they are provided
as an incentive to engage with the material to the best of your
ability, and as a diagnostic to ensure you're getting the benefits
that the assignments should provide.

<P>
In the next
assignment, you will select ten (cultural or natural) resources of
your choice for analysis and description. Before doing so, give some
critical thought to the domain and/or genre from which you will select
them. Write a 1-3 page justification, focusing on the
characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our
later exercises instructive for you. These characteristics might
include:
</P>
      
<UL>
<LI>
Your personal familiarity with and interest in the domain/genre.
</LI>
<LI>
Reasons people other than you have in locating and using
resources of this kind. Competing or conflicting interests are often a good sign.
</LI>
<LI>
Problems with or limitations of current approaches to
describing or classifying these kinds of resource.
</LI>
<LI>
Complexity of the resource (n.b., familiar resources are
often more complex than meets the eye).
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Please note that a domain or genre is not a topic. If you
select President Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) as the domain for this
assignment, then for the next assignment you'll need to identify ten
different deceased U.S. presidents, each of whom was named Abraham
Lincoln, and each of whom lived from 1809 to 1865. Examples of more
promising domains include:
</P>
<UL>

Select ten cultural or natural resources, all drawn from the
same domain, type, or genre. In later assignments, you will analyze
them with respect to their properties, the relations they stand in
with respect to each other, and their identity conditions. For this
assignment, write a brief, one paragraph natural language description of each
one. If your choice of domain/genre in the last assignment was a
mistake, include a discussion of the new domain or genre. Let your
choice of the ten be guided by those characteristics you considered in
assignment 1. In the interests of making your later assignments more
instructive, choose resources that collectively exhibit diversity,
highlight complexities, and push against the limitations and problems
of current descriptive practice.

The aim of this assignment is to choose a small number of
specific resources that can serve as the focus for your thinking about
and applying the description and organization issues we discuss this

Choose five properties or relations that will serve as a
basis for the organization and description of your ten resources. Most
or all of your resources should have some value on that property (or
stand in the relation to another resource). But not every resource
needs to exhibit the property or stand in the relation. Some
guidelines for choosing properties/relations include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Features that are of interest or concern to the
communities who have a stake in the resource or its use.
</LI>
<LI>
Properties that have 
<EM>
discriminatory power

 for
your resources (i.e., those which highlight contrasts or divide the
resources into categories.
</LI>
<LI>
Features that offer interesting or instructive
descriptive problems

properties and relations independently of how they are expressed or
