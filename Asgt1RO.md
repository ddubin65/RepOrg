# Assignment 1: resource domain/genre description {#Asgt1 .task}

## Rationale {.context}
The aim of this assignment is to help you relate the
topics in our readings and discussions to concrete examples that you
can explore in the homework assignments.

## Before you begin {.prereq}
In the next assignment, you will select ten (cultural or natural) resources of
your choice for analysis and description. 
Before doing so, give some
critical thought to the domain and/or genre from which you will select
them. Consider
characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our
later exercises instructive for you. These characteristics might
include:

- Your personal familiarity with and interest in the domain/genre.
- Reasons people other than you have in locating and using
  resources of this kind. Competing or conflicting interests are often a good sign.
- Problems with or limitations of current approaches to
  describing or classifying these kinds of resource.
- Complexity of the resource (n.b., familiar resources are
  often more complex than meets the eye).

Please note that a domain or genre is not a topic. If you
select President Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) as the domain for this
assignment, then for the next assignment you'll need to identify ten
different deceased U.S. presidents, each of whom was named Abraham
Lincoln, and each of whom lived from 1809 to 1865. Examples of more
promising domains include:

- Journal articles in zoology
- Your grandmother's postcard collection
- Eighth century Byzantine coins
- Prime numbers
- Board games
- Ethnographic data
- Young adult novels
- Mollusc shells

## Tasks {.steps}

1. Write a 1–3 page justification, focusing on the
   characteristics of the domain or genre that you believe will make our
   later exercises instructive for you.
