# Assignment 2: ten resources for description {#Asgt2 .task}

Select ten cultural or natural resources, all drawn from the
same domain, type, or genre. In later assignments, you will analyze
them with respect to their properties, the relations they stand in
with respect to each other, and their identity conditions. For this
assignment, write a brief, one paragraph natural language description of each
one. If your choice of domain/genre in the last assignment was a
mistake, include a discussion of the new domain or genre. Let your
choice of the ten be guided by those characteristics you considered in
assignment 1. In the interests of making your later assignments more
instructive, choose resources that collectively exhibit diversity,
highlight complexities, and push against the limitations and problems
of current descriptive practice.


## Rationale {.context}

The aim of this assignment is to choose a small number of
specific resources that can serve as the focus for your thinking about
and applying the description and organization issues we discuss this
semester.
